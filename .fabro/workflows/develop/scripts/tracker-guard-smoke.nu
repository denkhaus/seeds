# Smoke test for tracker-guard.nu's PURE decision logic (fabro-0da8):
# guard-decision/sd-issue-count over canned `complete`-style records —
# both-empty route, non-empty routes (open and in_progress arms), and
# the sd-failure fail-open contract (non-zero exit, invalid JSON,
# success:false) — without shelling to sd (the live-path is a manual
# invocation check, closeout-smoke pattern). The `source` const
# resolves against THIS file's directory, so the script runs from any
# cwd:
