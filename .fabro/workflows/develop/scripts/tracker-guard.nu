# Deterministic tracker guard (fabro-0da8): sits AFTER start and BEFORE
# the planner (ahead of the preflight too — a drained tracker makes the
# already-landed check moot), proving tracker state in ~1-3 s of shell
# so the drained-tracker terminal case costs ZERO planner tokens.
#
# Basis (run 01M0SFEYVC9TD6MP816RHEBFQY): planner@1 spent 27.7 s wall /
# 25.4 s inference / $0.0186 solely to discover 0 open seeds — what two
# `sd list` calls prove mechanically.
#
# Ownership rule (PROJECT_FACTS): BOTH calls filter `--assignee fabro
# --limit 200` — plain `sd list` would count unassigned/user-owned seeds
# this line must never work. The empty-tracker exit fires only when no
# FABRO-ASSIGNED seed remains (open or in_progress). `sd list` default
# output is OPEN issues only, which includes blocked-open seeds (per the
# seed body; `sd ready` alone lists unblocked only and would misroute,
# fabro-aa3d) — hence open via the default listing, in_progress via
# `--status in_progress`.
#
# Routes (output_schema="routing" on the node):
#   - BOTH lists empty -> preferred_next_label "Tracker empty" — the
#     existing label contract already declared on the planner's exit
#     edge, wired here to the plain exit edge (natural completion: the
#     goal is achieved, NOT an error; same family as the planner's own
#     "Tracker empty" edge).
#   - either non-empty -> preferred_next_label "Tracker non-empty"
#     (unconditional edge to the preflight, then the planner unchanged).
#     This node produces NO context value — none is required downstream.
#
# FAIL-OPEN (annotated choice): if `sd` errors, exits non-zero, or
# prints non-JSON output, the node routes "Tracker non-empty" (degraded
# mode) — it NEVER parks and NEVER fails the run: a broken tracker must
# not dead-end the dev loop, and the planner adjudicates the residue.
# Mirrors planner-preflight.nu's fail-open contract.
#
# Stale-claim requeue arm (fabro-d9f7): in_progress fabro-assigned seeds
# with NO live develop run claiming them, whose last claiming develop
# run's terminal activity (stage journal last ts) — or sd updatedAt when
# no develop journal claims the seed — is older than the stale
# threshold, are reset to open via `sd update <id> --status open
# --assignee fabro`. Orphaned claims stop pinning seeds outside
# `sd ready` eligibility. Claim association reuses the preflight's
# journal-claims mechanism (seed ids on `"node":"planner"` journal
# lines — the documented PROJECT_FACTS fallback); a claiming journal
# fresher than the threshold means a live run owns the claim and the
# seed is never requeued. fabro-32db alignment: a claim whose claiming
# journal is provably TERMINAL (last record node `closeout` — the
# develop graph's terminal node) is NOT in flight and is requeueable
# IMMEDIATELY, no 6h wait; live (non-terminal) claims alone keep the
# reference clock. Runs whose terminality is unprovable (journal
# absent — e.g. a failed run's branch-only journal — or ending
# mid-flight) keep the 6h journal-silence clock / sd updatedAt
# fallback.
# Fail-open on this arm too: degraded inputs (sd
# failure, unreadable journal dir) skip requeueing entirely and report
# degraded — never a false requeue. Self-exclusion at BOTH grains: the
# current run's journal is skipped entirely (the engine pipes
# internal.run_id on stdin, planner-preflight idiom), and
# FABRO_GUARD_CURRENT_SEED names the claimed seed for manual runs.
# Requeued ids land in the output's `requeued` array; the
# outcome/preferred_next_label semantics above are unchanged.

# Stale threshold in hours. Default 6h: develop runs complete in
# minutes-to-hours (the loop cycles seeds continuously), so a claiming
# journal silent for 6h belongs to a terminal or abandoned run — its
# claim is orphaned. The brief's observable-today pair (fabro-29f7,
# fabro-6a78) sat terminal 9h/7.5h with no live run at implementation
# time, which a 24h default would not reach. Override:
# FABRO_GUARD_STALE_HOURS.
