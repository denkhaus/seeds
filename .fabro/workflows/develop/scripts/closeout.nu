# Closeout (ADR-0010): deterministic post-approval bookkeeping.
#
# The reviewer's Approved edge lands HERE. This script closes EXACTLY the
# seed this run worked on — delivered by the engine via stdin
# (stdin_source="current_seed_id" on the node). One seed per run: after a
# successful close the run exits; the next seed is the next run's job
# (user directive 2026-09-04 — bounded runs give the revisor a clear,
# single-seed working field and keep run cost predictable).
#
# The seed id comes from CONTEXT, never from "first in_progress seed":
# the tracker carries parallel claims (stale or live), and run
# 01M1NK4V3YG3AQAMEKDJ6V471F closed two WRONG stale seeds
# that way before this fix.
#
# Never an LLM: run 01M0… measured planner@2 at 21s / $0.021 / ~7% of wall
# time for exactly these mechanical actions. Failure keeps the seed open —
# the next run re-enters the review cycle; an approved-but-unclosed seed is
# re-approvable harmlessly.

# Dockerfile-touch warning (fabro-6f6e)
#
# WHY: run 01M1YTVK73YEJXW4542MWDX4BJ (seed fabro-05d0) delivered only a
# .fabro/Dockerfile.toolchain edit; Docker is absent from run sandboxes so
# no image build ran, the review approved green — yet the fix stayed INERT
# because fabro-toolchain:noble is BUILT, not mounted, and a Dockerfile*
# edit takes effect only after that image rebuilds. Same class as the gh
# breakage in .fabro/Dockerfile (since 98ed9f1) that still produced exit
# 127 in run containers on Sep 7. This warning names the touched files at
# the moment the close is decided. It must NEVER fail or block the close:
# every git call below is wrapped in `do { ... } | complete` (git errors
# degrade to silence) and the whole check runs under `do -i` — `complete`
# only accepts external commands, so the outer guard is do-i rather than
# do|complete, with the same degrade-to-silence semantics.
#
# SPEC SCOPE: run-summary/PR-body surfacing of this warning is exactly the
# channel open seed fabro-5b0a proposes and does NOT exist yet — this seed
# deliberately does NOT build it. The warning's captured stdout/stderr
# lands in the stage journal and run output, which satisfies this seed;
# fabro-5b0a remains the follow-up for PR-body surfacing.

# Closure-discipline pre-close check (fabro-02c4)
#
# WHY: seed fabro-9967 was closed 2026-09-09 15:42 (in a seeds:sync)
# although its demand (sd ready cap + created_since in planner.md) was
# never implemented — NO implementing diff existed — and the revisor
# caught it only by accident while deduping (run 01M23J61HH8Z,
# regression finding). Before its `sd close`, this gate verifies the
# run actually delivered a diff the seed's demand is visible in
# (claim-base anchored — the same seed-claim-base/run-base helpers the
# Dockerfile warning uses). If not visible, the run does NOT close: the
# seed stays OPEN and a PARK note goes to stdout AND stderr (both land
# in the stage journal / run output) for the next cycle to act on.
#
# Tracker/journal bookkeeping (`.seeds`, `.fabro/journal`) is excluded
# from the patch: those files mechanically echo seed metadata (the
# claim itself, journal records quoting the brief) and would satisfy
# the match with zero implementation.
#
# Degrade-to-close: any git/sd failure inside the verdict returns
# visible=true — this gate must never block a legitimate close on
# tooling error (same philosophy as the Dockerfile warning above). An
# empty token set (title unparsable) degrades to a non-empty-patch
# check.

# existed to fold the follow-up into. This sweep re-files each explicitly
# non-blocking reviewer observation as a NEW open seed BEFORE the close,
# with provenance (finding text, closed seed id, source run id) in the
# body so the finding survives closure traceably.
#
# ADVISORY ONLY: every failure (journal missing, JSON unparsable, sd
# create error) logs to stderr and NEVER blocks the close — same
# degrade-to-silence philosophy as warn-dockerfile-diff (`do -i` +
