# Claim-contract gate (fabro-c42f stopgap, 2026-09-18): the engine resolves
# stdin_source="current_seed_id" BEFORE this script runs — a missing key
# fails the node deterministically within seconds, so a planner whose
# structured output validated routing but dropped its context_updates
# (observed: 349-char {"outcome":"succeeded",...} prose-hybrid, runs
# 01M2SN3TE4FZ / 01M2SRK0PCDX / 01M2SW12V6WK) parks the run EARLY instead
# of burning a 20-30 min implementer cycle and dying at the evidence node.
# When the key exists, this script only asserts it is non-empty and
# well-formed (fabro- seed id prefix).

def main []: nothing -> nothing {
    # Non-tty stdin: nu's `input` only works on a tty; the engine pipes the
    # context value, so read it through an external `cat` (closeout idiom).
