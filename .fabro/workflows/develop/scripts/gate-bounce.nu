# Gate-bounce known-bug enrichment (fabro-56f4): deterministic, never an LLM.
#
# Sits on the Gate red path between tester and implementer. Run evidence
# (01M1XN2KWG6T0PHRTJWZ8R0AZX): implementer@2 re-derived the root cause of a
# gate failure from a 186 KB log blob (704 s, $0.38) although the exact
# failure was already filed as open seed fabro-febd. This script matches the
# gate failure tail against OPEN seeds carrying the `workflows` label and
# prints the matching seed bodies as JSON, which the engine stores under
# `output.gate_known_bug_hits` (command-node output_schema mechanism) and
# renders inline in the implementer's ## Context section.
#
# Best-effort semantics (the bounce must never be stranded): every internal
# failure — sd unavailable, unreadable tail — prints a brace-free warning and
# exits 0 with empty hits. Warnings MUST stay brace-free: the engine merges
# stderr into the captured stdout (`exec 2>&1`) and the output_schema
# validator scans for balanced JSON objects, so braces in warnings would
# poison the extraction.
#
# Matching is deterministic and case-insensitive: distinctive compounds —
# runs of at least 6 chars of [a-z0-9_/-] starting with a letter that carry a
# separator or digit (e.g. `target/debug/fabro`, `get_graph_returns_svg`,
# `fabro-server`, `openapi-generator-cli`), or a rare word of >= 12 chars —
# extracted from each seed's title+description must appear as substrings of
# the lowercased failure tail; a seed matches when at least 2 distinct
# compounds hit. Bare short words (`server`, `target`, `render`) occur in
# every gate log AND in most seed prose — counting them produced immediate
# false positives (fabro-5453/fabro-0195 matching an unrelated febd tail),
# so only separator-bearing compounds and long rare words count.

# Gate-log generics >= 6 chars: no matching signal, present in every tail.
