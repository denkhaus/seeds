# Capture review evidence for the reviewer (read-only by capability and
# policy since fabro-1dae; tools available for verification).
#
# PIPE (agent-reviewer era, run 01M0T2GW): the reviewer is an agent node
# with real tools, and the engine materializes demoted values as blob
# files in the sandbox (.fabro/blobs/<sha>.json) that the reviewer reads
# on demand. Consequence: this capture is COMPLETE — it does not
# self-budget. The old 6.8k self-budget was a workaround for the
# prompt-node reviewer (tool_time_ms 0, blob refs unreadable) and it cut
# exactly the wrong files: run 01M0T2GW reviewer@3 journaled that the
# budget walk kept README.md and omitted main.go + fib_test.go — the
# files the review hinged on.
#
# Size handling is the ENGINE's business now: a large capture is demoted
# to a preview-plus-blobref marker, and the reviewer follows the blobref
# link (its prompt says so). Completeness is THIS script's business:
# every seed-work diff is included, source files before docs, the seed
# spec untruncated. Inputs that arrive as blob refs are resolved inline
# (resolve-blobrefs); unresolvable refs pass through as links rather
# than being dropped.
#
# HARD_CAP is a pathological-input safety only (a generated 50MB file in
# the diff must not produce an unbounded blob): on cap the disclosure
# names what was cut, and source-first ordering guarantees docs go first.
#
# Structure: private helpers resolve the facts (run base, numstat
# grouping, in-progress seed), section printers render one evidence
# section each, and `main` wires them in the critical-first order.
# Output text is contract: the reviewer prompt names these sections —
# change wording there too.

# Dev-loop machinery this repo owns; never part of a seed's review scope.
