# Graph-contract smoke (fabro-83df / fabro-92e2, 2026-09-19): pins the
# develop graph's deterministic-exit contract that the 2026-09-19
# goal-gate incident broke. Pure file assertions, no sd, no git — the
# same closeout-smoke pattern (checked into the repo, wired into
# scripts/qualitygate.nu's loop-asset tier).
#
#   nu .fabro/workflows/develop/scripts/graph-contract-smoke.nu
#
# Contract:
#   1. planner node carries NO goal_gate — the deterministic guards
#      (tracker_guard) legitimately bypass it; a gate made those runs
#      die with "goal gate unsatisfied for node planner".
#   2. NO preflight -> exit edge — the preflight is report-only
#      (fabro-83df); a landed-but-open top candidate is the planner's
#      decision, never a script exit.
#   3. tracker_guard -> exit ("Tracker empty") edge EXISTS — the
#      zero-token drained-tracker exit must stay.
#   4. preflight -> planner ("Preflight done") edge EXISTS — the
#      unconditional fail-open route must stay.
#   5. planner -> exit ("Already landed") edge EXISTS — the planner's
#      own decision exit must stay.
