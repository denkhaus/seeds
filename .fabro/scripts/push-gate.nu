# Push gate for the local iterate/line-watch cycle (user directive
# 2026-09-17: NEVER push to main while a pass runs; seeds-e5af: make it a
# deterministic lefthook pre-push hook, and treat quota-parked runs as
# NON-blocking).
#
# Two conditions, both must hold for OPEN:
#   (a) NO active run on the production server (status.kind not in the
#       terminal set: succeeded/failed/canceled) — conductor, develop,
#       revisor, architect, anything. NOTE: fabro ps --json carries
#       status as {"kind": "..."} — a string compare against 'running'
#       silently passes while runs are active (the 2026-09-17 violation).
#       EXCEPTION (seeds-e5af): runs blocked for quota
#       (blocked/quota_rate_limit) are PARKED, not active — parked runs
#       must never permanently refuse pushes.
#   (b) NO open run-PR on the line repo.
#
# Exit 0 = GATE OPEN (push allowed). Exit 1 = REFUSED (prints why).
# Usage: nu .fabro/scripts/push-gate.nu [--server https://mirtuell.net]
#        [--repo denkhaus/seeds]

# Pure predicate: does this run record justify REFUSING a push?
# Exported for the fixture battery (.fabro/scripts/push-gate-fixtures.nu);
# `use` (unlike `source`) does not auto-invoke this file's `def main`.
