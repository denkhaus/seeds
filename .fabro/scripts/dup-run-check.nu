# Deterministic duplicate-run preflight (fabro-8c75): does a merged
# IMPLEMENTATION of the given seed id(s) already exist on the merge-target
# branch? Replaces the any-commit grep + LLM-judgment clause in the
# implementer preflight and the revisor duplicate-run check (Step 3.5).
#
# Usage:
#   nu .fabro/scripts/dup-run-check.nu <seed-id> [<seed-id>...] [--base <ref>] [--self <run-id>]
#   (default base: origin/denkhaus — the FACTS merge-target branch)
#
# Mechanical classification, no LLM judgment:
#   - tracker-authoritative: `sd show <id>` status closed -> duplicate,
#     UNLESS the closing evidence classifies as a self-closure (--self).
#   - history: commits on the base ref referencing the seed id, restricted
#     to LANDED-PR commits — true merge commits (2-parent) OR squash-merge
#     subjects ending in `(#<n>)`.
#   - a landed-PR commit whose subject names a revisor pass only FILED the
#     seed -> filed-only, NOT a duplicate.
#   - non-PR commits referencing the id (seed-sync/tracker churn) are
#     reported as `other` — informational, never a duplicate.
#
# Closure identity (fabro-e6a0): every implementation match carries a
# `closure` field derived from the commit's `Fabro-Run:` trailer —
#   self    the trailer names the invoking run (--self <run-id>)
#   foreign anything else (no trailer, or a different run); the raw
#           trailer run-id ships as `trailer_run` for consumers
# Self matches never drive a `duplicate` verdict: with --self supplied they
# auto-downgrade the verdict to `clean` with a `closure_note`. Status-
# independent: an in_progress seed whose own landed PR matches is a
# self-closure, not a duplicate. When the tracker says closed but no
# implementation match exists, the closing commit is resolved (last commit
# touching .seeds referencing the id, else any body-matching commit) and
# reported as `closing_evidence` with the same closure classification.
#
# Regression (fabro-395b, 2026-09-19): landed commits that merely REOPEN,
# VERIFY, or do tracker bookkeeping for the named seed (e769f791
# 'fabro-29f7: reopen gate seed, verify upstream offers remain unmerged
# ... (#250)'; f3c12e03 'Verify fabro-6a78 fix in-tree; move seed to
# in_progress ... (#254)') used to count as landed implementations and
# mechanically re-closed deliberately reopened seeds in the pre-planner
# preflight (incident runs 01M2WG2Z42N8P2QKX0K7VXT1MC /
# 01M2WHTHVGK360638W9H9PN2BT). Such subjects now classify filed-only.
#
# Output: one JSON object per seed id (JSONL stream on stdout). Verdicts:
#   duplicate | clean | degraded
# Exit 0 unless the invocation itself is wrong (then 2).

# fabro-a32f: the filed-only marker covers every revisor-line commit
# convention observed on the merge target, not just `Revisor pass:` —
# `Revise run <id>; file fabro-xxxx (#n)` (e.g. a7ee183 filing
# fabro-ea41/fabro-7aac via PR #206) and `file N ... seeds` subjects
# MERELY FILE the named seeds and must never count as landed
# implementations. Conservative by design: when a revisor commit both
# implements and files, it is classified filed-only (a false negative
# routes the planner normally; a false positive would mechanically
# close live work in the pre-planner preflight).
# fabro-0d48: also cover the comma/and-separated `file seeds fabro-X
# and fabro-Y` shape (e.g. 706d639 'Improve: revise develop run
# 01M2Q7VVH, file seeds fabro-6ae9 and fabro-... (#212)') and the
# `revise develop run` variant of the revise-run phrase — previously
# neither matched, so revisor filing commits landed among
# implementations with closure=foreign and forced verdict=duplicate.
# fabro-395b: also classify tracker-bookkeeping subjects naming the seed
# — reopen/verify/move-seed/close-seed phrasings (incident: e769f791
# 'fabro-29f7: reopen gate seed, verify ... (#250)' and f3c12e03
# 'Verify fabro-6a78 fix in-tree; move seed to in_progress ... (#254)'

# direction: a false negative routes the planner; a false positive would
